    <string name="txt">There are many types of coffees in the world and the main species are Arabica and Robusta.  Arabica is a high quality, mild coffee much favoured for blending.

Kenyan Arabica is grown on rich volcanic soils found in the highlands between 1400 to 2000 meters above sea level.  It is an established fact the finest Arabic coffee in the world is grown in Kenya.

The climate is never hotter than an European summer and never cooler than the best kind of European spring with a temperature range of not more than 19C (35F).  Rainfall is well distributed throughout the year where coffee is grown with an annual precipitation not less that 1000 mm (35‚Äù) and deep well-drained red loam soils.  These conditions make most of the districts in Kenya where coffee is grown unique in the world.  There are broad, gently rounded ridges, sloping not too steeply into valleys which run swift perennial streams.  The red volcanic soil is of great depth and fertility on the slopes ensuring good drainage.

Coffee production goes through a systematic protocol from seed to cup from nursery, farm, pulping, milling and grading.  Attention to detail guarantees that the consumer only gets the best of our Kenya Coffee.</string>
